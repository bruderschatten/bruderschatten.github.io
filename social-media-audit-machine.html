    <p><strong>Are we thinking hard, or are we hardly thinking?</strong></p>
<p>Today I enjoyed watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Cadwalladr">Carole Cadwalladr</a> articulately deconstruct Facebook's culpability in the 2016 Brexit vote in this TED Talk:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carole_cadwalladr_facebook_s_role_in_brexit_and_the_threat_to_democracy/transcript?language=en#t-250629">Facebook's role in Brexit - and the threat to democracy</a></p>
<p>In a passionate polemic, she laid the blame of the 2016 election results squarely on Facebook's doorste with a bold and dire thesis:  liberal democracy is broken because </p>
<ol>
<li>Facebook complicitly allows illegal disinformation campaigns to flourish on its platform -and-</li>
<li>Facebook's advertising data are hidden from public scrutiny and journalistic accountability</li>
</ol>
<p>Ms. Cadwalladr points out that Facebook's advertising targeting allows disinformation to be ephemerally displayed to specific people.  Then in a puff of smoke, the audit trail of the disinformation campaign vanishes before a broader audience can review or respond to the threat.</p>
<p>Pondering many possible technical solutions to this problem, let's ignore any notion that Facebook should be involved in the solution.  The very notion of self-regulation would face myriad technical, legal, and pragmatic hurtles; I won't even begin to enterain them here.   Rather I think we should focus on technical solutions which already exist and already regulate the world of social media.</p>
<p>Let's remember that the technology already exists to create and manage <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-deleted-583-million-fake-accounts-in-the-first-three-months-of-2018/">millions of fake Facebook accounts</a>.  These millions of accounts are not created by millions of people, they are created by software.  The majority of them are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=black+hat+definition">"black hat"</a>, in that they exist to nefariously defraud Facebook, its users, and the public trust.  However, some of those accounts are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_hat">"grey hat"</a> and exist at the behest of Facebook itself and other companies who monitor the security of their clients' social media profiles.</p>
<p>To Facebook, these grey hat accounts look just like you and me.  They visit Facbook every day, post updates, and share stories.  They also subscribe to the Facebook feeds for premium brands like Citibank and Warner Bros.  This diligent army of fake profiles never sleeps and never takes holiday; they monitor the social media assets of clients with deep pockets who could suffer dramatic financial or social liability if their accounts were hacked or broken.   These fake armies of virtual social media users are managed by security companies who operate outside of the public limelight shone on Facebooks, Google and other large tech firms.</p>
<p>Perhaps its time to review the playbooks of these social media security companies.  Most of them use sophisticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">crawlers</a> to anonymously blend into the crowd of legitimate users accessing Facebook.   Consider: if instead of crawling the social media pages of Citibank, virtual accounts crawled the social profiles of thousands of users around the world, a diverse group of profiles representing every color, creed, ethnicity, gender, age and location around the world, we could build a public audit trail of Facebook.</p>
<p><img alt="Audit Trail" src="/images/audit-trail.jpg"></p>
<p>Using the same tricks of the trade employed by the social media security companies, we could fully anonymize the behavior of this audit service.   We could then publish the results publicly, making a public record of the social media streams for different types of profiles world-wide.   The service by itself would not stop a nefarious propagandist from creating a disinformation campaign, but there would forever be a permanent record of all such campaigns which could be reviewed by journalists, law enforcement and any concerned citizen.</p>
<p>Let's discuss and potentially create a public technical specifciation or RFC for review.  </p>
